However, while attempting the second sub-goal, 'put the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate', the robot's arm collided with the already placed white mug, knocking it over and off its centered position on the plate. This collision effectively undid the success of the first sub-goal. Furthermore, the video ends before the robot successfully places the chocolate pudding to the right of the plate. Therefore, the overall goal was not achieved.",
