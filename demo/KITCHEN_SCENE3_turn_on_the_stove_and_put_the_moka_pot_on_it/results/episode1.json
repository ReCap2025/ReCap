        "explanation": "1. Sub-goals required to achieve the main goal are: (a) Turn on the stove, (b) Put the left moka pot on the stove. \n2. Evaluation of each sub-goal:\n- 'Turn on the stove': By the third image, the stove heating element is visibly glowing red, indicating it is on. Thus, turning on the stove has been achieved.\n- 'Put the left moka pot on the stove': The robot moves towards the moka pot and appears to make an attempt to grasp it. However, by the last image, the moka pot is not placed on the stove; it remains roughly in the same position on the table.\n3. Actions in the video for each sub-goal:\n- For turning on the stove: The robot arm clearly actuates the stove control and the stove turns on (glows red).\n- For placing the moka pot: The robot arm approaches and touches/grabs the moka pot but does not lift and place it on the stove. The object remains on the table, not on the stove.\n4. Reasons for success/failure:\n- 'Turn on the stove' is successful because the stove is activated.\n- 'Put the left moka pot on the stove' is unsuccessful because the moka pot was not moved to or released on the stove.",
