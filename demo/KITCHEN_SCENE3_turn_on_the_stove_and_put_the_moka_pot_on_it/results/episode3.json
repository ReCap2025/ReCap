        "explanation": "1. Sub-goals to achieve the main goal 'turn on the stove and put the moka pot on it' are: (a) Turn on the stove. (b) Put the left moka pot on the stove (and release the gripper). 2. Sub-goal (a) is fulfilled as the stove is visibly turned on (red heating element is glowing in the third and subsequent frames). 3. Sub-goal (b) is not fulfilled: the moka pot has not been moved from its starting location, nor placed on the stove at any time. No action of grasping, lifting, or attempted placement of the moka pot is observed; the robot manipulator moves away from the stove and approaches the pan instead. 4. The robot succeeded in turning on the stove, but failed to pick up and place the moka pot on the stove, leaving it on the table. The action to put the moka pot on the stove was entirely omitted or failed to execute.",
