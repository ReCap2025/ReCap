        "explanation": "1. The sub-goals required to achieve the main goal ('turn on the stove and put the moka pot on it') are: (a) Turn on the stove; (b) Pick up the left moka pot; (c) Place the left moka pot on the stove and release it.\n\n2. Observing the frames:\n- For sub-goal (a): The robot moves the control over the stove, and in frame 3, the heating element glows red, indicating the stove is turned on. This sub-goal is fulfilled.\n- For sub-goal (b): The robot moves its gripper towards the left moka pot, but there is no clear indication that it successfully grasps and lifts the moka pot. It appears to just touch it.\n- For sub-goal (c): The moka pot does not appear on the stove at the end. It remains on the table in its original position. There is no release of the moka pot onto the stove. This sub-goal is not fulfilled.\n\n3. Action mapping:\n- For 'turn on the stove', the corresponding action (manipulating the stove and heating element glowing) matches the language plan.\n- For 'put the left moka pot on the stove', the robot attempts to interact but fails to move or place the moka pot onto the stove. The moka pot remains in its original place.\n\n4. Reasons:\n- 'Turn on the stove' succeeded because the visual cue (heating element glowing) confirms the action.\n- 'Put the left moka pot on the stove' failed because the moka pot never leaves its position on the table, and there is no evidence of the gripper manipulating or releasing it over the stove.",
