        "explanation": "1. The sub-goals to achieve the main goal 'turn on the stove and put the moka pot on it' are: (a) turn on the stove, and (b) put the left moka pot on the stove. 2. Sub-goal (a) 'turn on the stove' is fulfilled: images show the robot interacting with the stove knob, and the stove visibly lights up red, indicating it's on. Sub-goal (b) 'put the left moka pot on the stove' is fulfilled: the robot grasps the moka pot, moves it over the stove, and releases it on the burner. 3. Each sub-goal has corresponding, successful actions in the video. 4. Both instructions in the language plan succeed, because the robot precisely completes each one as intended, including releasing the moka pot on the correct position.",
