        "explanation": "1. Sub-goals required to achieve the main goal are: (a) Turn on the stove. (b) Put the right moka pot on the stove and make sure it is released by the gripper and placed on the heating element.\n2. Sub-goal (a) is fulfilled as shown in images 3\u20137, where the stove turns on (heating element glows red). Sub-goal (b) is not fulfilled; the moka pot remains on the table throughout all images, and the robot arm does not attempt to pick it up or place it on the stove.\n3. There are no actions in the video attempting to pick up or move the moka pot. All robot actions are directed toward the stove (turning it on) and not toward interacting with the moka pot.\n4. The instruction 'turn on the stove' succeeds because the stove is turned on as visible in the images. The instruction 'put the right moka pot on the stove' fails because there is no evidence that the moka pot was picked up or placed on the stove.",
